# CYOA: A text-based choose-your-own-adventure dungeon crawler!

With all files in the same directory, open CYOA.html in a web browser to play!


## Features
- multiple class and race options, each giving custom stats and dialogue
- turn-based combat that takes into account stealth, speed and the difference between melee, ranged, and magic attacks
- dynamic mini-map that updates based on which rooms the player can see and has visited
- queue-based game system written in JavaScript that handles dialogue, room movement, battles, treasure chests, etc.


Created in 2019 by Maven Bruggemann for a high school class final project.


**While all code and dialogue was written by me, the images included in the project are not mine.**
